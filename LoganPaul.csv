-1,What the hell is wrong with him???,
0,White privledge,
0,cameron truitt Sure Logan's white but that alone isn't why he was able to do the things he did: it was because he's one of YouTube's biggest cash cows so they exercised little to no control over the content he uploaded including the strikes he's already avoided (because YouTube does show favoritism towards him even when they are forced to punish him),
-1,F you logan,
0,Yikes,
0,seems like a regular american to me,
-1,How can you be this rude?!?!?,
-1,Am I the only Logan Paul hater who isnt even a teen yet? Like seriously,why do so many idiot kids barley younger than me think this is entertainment
0,Trouts of Insanity Luckily you're not the only one as  I've found a couple of ex-Logangsters/haters ranging in ages as young as 5 to kids that just turned teen (sadly there are far more kids/preteens/teens/adolescents who do still support Logan).,
0,As to your second question... Unless you're just being rhetorical as a psych major I can try to explain it if you want but be warned it's a doozy of information...
-1,and he says Japan is all about respect when he himself is disrespecting Japan and the people,
-1,That's a filthy piece of thrash which have no right to live in this world. Doing things he shouldn't just to get viewers and popularity. There are thousands of people like him. But don't worry karma is a bitch and will go back to you in least expected moment.
0,He's gonna have to live with this video the rest of his life.,
1,*Respect,at it's finest.*
0,he just wanted to be remembered. he wanted attention. that's why he did this. he's all about attention.,
-1,While I personally don't feel this is an acceptable excuse I won't deny that it is completely accurate
0,To be honest I dont see anything wrong with this guy. Though Id rather watch him chug a gallon of meth-water 1:1 ratio mix by volume in 1 minute and see what transpires afterwards...for science of course!
0,Look at Felix,he already goes to Japan like 2 times this year and respect the place
1,I see nothing wrong with what he did,
-1,Are you defending this asshole?,
-1,Logan Paul or Jake whatever the fuck are pretty obnoxious. just my opinion so don't shame me. -_-,

0,Can he do it front Yakuza ?,
0,Lost in a world where no one is laughing the higher you jump the harder you fall. Go away and have a think take everything apart and build yourself back up in a way you want to be. Write express yourself and come back with some content. Wild screams echo ten times louder in the hollow abyss.,,,
-1,Subhuman,
-1,Embarrassment to the human race.,
-1,It hurt to watch every time he annoyed someone,
-1,This is so DISRESPECTFUL I love Japan and to see someone being rude to Japanese culture and making fun of it makes me so ANGRY and I'm not even Japanese. He's just lucky that most of Japanese people are patient and kind or he would of been yelled at and kicked out of Japan.
-1,What the fuck did I just watch?,
-1,This kid needs to be put up for adoption,
-1,That guy is freaking douche bag. Glad im not part his generation. A complete fool!,
0,PEOPLE love him? How in the world did he got millions of subscribers?,
-1,Logan Paul you are mother fucking culture-less American son of a bitch who came to make a mess in Japan. I wish if you encounter a gang nasty Japanese who gave you a big crushing blow to your face and fracture your skull and break your arm and hand. And imagine if you are struggle with someone who wanted to hurt you badly,and you scream so loud,they stuck in red hot chilly into your mouth and jam it up with something to shut you off while let your pain screamed out voicelessly,imagine the real pains you gonna get..  you are basically taking the liberty you get in Japan for granted. You should get a whack. Logan,if you happened to encounter a few Real Japanese Yakuza,few of them would not let you die peacefully... they would tie you up and have your throat slit up and let your  blood drip and your  body hang up side down at the main gate of US embassy without anyone giving a damn on your scar-up corpse..,

-1,How is he not in jail,
-1,That very disrespectful to the Shinto religion and to Japan.,
-1,What the fuck is this mate thinking? That is absolutely breaching the etiquette of the Japanese society. I cant believe how insensitive he was towards the Japanese. Tokyo may be an international city,but not everyone knows English. He should have learn some Japanese before going. I assumed he goofed around at Yasukuni Shrine too. Tourists should be careful about going to that place because some people may be sensitive about certain spots. I dont think he has done research before enthering Japan. These actions are so unforgiveable. Such behaviour will result being blacklisted. If I see this mate doing all sorts of rubbish in other countries,then he shall be banned from leaving USA. When I travelled to Japan,I always stay on my best behaviour. I learned few useful Japanese expressions. I dont demonstrate this type of horseplay when I was there. To all tourists,try to study the language before going to a foreign country. Also study the norms as well because every country have difference rules. That way,travelling experience will be more pleasant.,

0,These people are normal people,just Japanese,they are not Pokmon or anything like that. This man needs to be taught some manners. I am half his age and I still know that this is not a proper way to act. Did you learn how to be stupid in high school? I am pretty sure that's the only subject you passed. Your only job is YouTube.

1,Logan Paul Should try this in Myanmar,he will have great content and gets locked up for a few months for disrespecting the culture. Can't believe people are furious over only a suicide forest footage. He walks around with an octopus tentacle & dead fish while people are eating. He should be Banned for life from Youtube.

-1,Who watches this shit. Logan Is just awful...,
-1,Booooooo Logan Paul,
-1,Idiot. No brains in his head at all. The immature man child needs to be punished properly. Honestly I think he needs to see a psychologist and get a grip on reality as it's not normal to behave like that at his age (or at any age for that matter).,
-1,What makes it worse is that he has a fan base actively encouraging this sort of behaviour. A lot of sick immature people out there :-/,
0,I think the only reason the police never arrested him was to prevent a diplomatic issue. I certainly would have locked him up to teach him a lesson about respect.,
0,As a Japanese person,it  annoys me when he doesn't understand people insulting him
-1,OMG I SWEAR LOGAN DO U EVEN CARE FOR OThER PEOPLE???!!!! OMG LIKE YOUR IN A NEW COUNTRY YOU SHOULD AT LEAST TRY TO BE RESPECTFUL OF THEM JEZ THEY ARE JUST NORMAL PEOPLE..,

-1,Yo is Logan freaking retarded like if u agree,
-1,Hes actually the biggest fuckin idiot Ive ever seen,
-1,Logan is such a garbage human being,
0,You know,I have friends who have worked two jobs to save up the money to visit Japan. They've have spent years studying the culture -- the good AND the bad -- and the language,because they genuinely love the country and its people and want to be as respectful and assimilate as well as possible.,,,,
0,Meanwhile,this twat has his viewers pay for his trip overseas so he can run around screaming like a retard and making a jackass of himself in front of millions.
0,*MUCH-O BROKEN-O*,

0,PANTS COMING DOWN,
-1,i really hate him,
0,Bye bitch x,
-1,Japan is offended of Logan Paul and everyone there probably searched his channel and disliked all of his vids,
-1,he is an asshole,
0,As a fellow American,I'd like to apologize to all of Japan for the disrespect this idiot showed your culture,country and people. His behavior does not represent the majority.,,,,
1,+96 lol,believe wht u wnt about HIS-story,I'm referring to the present and the majority of Americans I've encountered don't behave this way at all,which is y this made the news (not typical or accepted behavior),,,
0,Omg...,
