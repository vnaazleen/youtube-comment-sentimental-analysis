que parte de m saba al segundo que lo v que sto pasaraEn realidad no es algo que l haya dicho o hechoEra la sensacin que sto envolvaY lo ms desconcertante es que no s si volver a sentirme as otra vezAn as no s si debera Saba que su mundo se mova de manera rpida y que brillaba cual solPero pens Cmo puede el diablo empujarte a los brazos de alguien que luce lo ms parecido a un ngel cuando te sonreQuiz l lo saba cuando me vioSupongo que perd mi balance Pienso que la peor parte de todo esto no fue perderlo a l sino perderme a mrase una vezAlgunos errores atrsEstaba en tu vistaMe agarraste solaMe encontrasteMe encontrasteMe aprisionasteeeSupongo que no me importY supongo que me gustY cuando ya haba cadoDiste un paso atrsSin m sin m sin mY hace mucho queNo est junto a mY me doy cuenta queLa culpa es maPorque saba que eras un problema cuando entrasteQu vergenza de mMe llevaste a lugares donde nunca haba estadoY as me dejaste tiradaSaba que eras un problema cuando entrasteQu vergenza de mMe llevaste a lugares donde nunca haba estadoAhora estoy tirada en el fro sueloOh oh problema problema problemaOh oh problema problema problemaNo ms disculpasl nunca te ver llorarActa como si no lo notaraEs por eso queTe ahogas te ahogas te ahogasasasO que te mudasteDe susurros en la calleUn nuevo logro en tu rcordEs todo lo que siempre serY ahora lo s ahora lo s ahora lo sY hace mucho queLleg a mY ahora me doy cuenta queSiempre su burla fuCoroCuando tu miedo ms triste arrastrndose te hace verQue nunca me amaste ni a ella ni a nadie ni a nadaSCoroPorque saba que eras un problema cuando entrasteProblema problema problemaPorque saba que eras un problema cuando entrasteProblema problema problemaNo s si sabes quin eres hasta que pierdes a quin eres,Before 400 mill   Someone,I
