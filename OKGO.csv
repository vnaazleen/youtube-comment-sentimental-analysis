Either way it's amazing.;;1;i think its funny that anyone cares about the paper. the printers are what you should be worried about, that and ink.;;0;"they have a real ""obsession"" with making extremely difficult videos";;1;OK GO never disappoint me. Stay amazing.;;1;Yet another randomly impressive video from OK Go. Now if only their music wasn't completely worthless.;;1;I like the sound  _;;1;am I being hypnotized? ??;;0;I live in a paperless household.  This is so retro.;;1;You guys are so talented and so good at  making awesome videos.

I'd appreciate if you'd add captions or subtitles to this video. whats even more? it is not auto-translated or auto-generated.;;0;I have an obsession with hearing your next studio album. New album when?;;1;Once again, OK Go prove why they're the absolute best at music videos.;;1;i've watched this 5 times;;-1;Works better when the song is good;;-1;Rip off of nite runner by Duran Duran lol;;1;THIS IS AMAZING! How do y'all come up with these ideas, and make them into these awesome music videos! Y'all are exceptional.;;1;"Thank you for the heads up, I am one of the ""flashing light affected"" it's crazy how the brain can short circuit.  Amazing talent...impressive...";;0;lol;;-1;This is not a music video, it's a printer commercial.;;-1;They must have spend a lot of woods and trees :(;;0;"Dunder Mifflin; Limitless paper, in a paperless world";;1;This is like New Order and Pet Shop Boys had a baby. I love it!!;;0;how many trees were there?;;1;Fuck that was crazy.;;0;I think this was directed by Michael Scott.;;0;Thank you for the pre warning- I get migraines easy so I was careful..;;1;Awesome! Like...always :D OK Go always have the best ideas for making a music viceo super creativ. It's always entertaining and fun to watch this. I don't want to know how much time they spend on filming things likes that but...keep going! <3 Awesome work! <3;;1;I envy and pray for the editor(s) of this video.;;-1;SO concerned over the amount of ink they used. You can recycle the paper, but not the ink. A little disappointed in this, fellas.;;0;Okay, but now I really want to go and purchase coloured paper?;;1;"Wow!  I first imagined they had 'stacked' the paper feeders with colored paper, but soon realized that would be less likely than actually burning all that ink. Just ""Wow.""";;0;Those papers has same amount of homework;;0;We love trees.;;-1;"The video-editing kinda ruins the ""live"" feel that your old videos had.";;-1;Let's love trees.;;-1;who mixed this?;;-1;bitch, what the fuck!!!;;0;Does anyone know what model printer this is?;;0;I liked the part where the paper printed out;;1;Is there even a limit to their creativity  (and possibly their budget) ?;;1;I LOVE YOU ALL.;;1;"In an era when MTV no longer stands for Music Television, OK Go keeps the spirit of the music video art form alive and consistently innovated. Your videos remind me of old Peter Gabriel videos like ""Sledge Hammer"" and ""Steam"" when he was constantly raising the bar.";;0;Fuck sustainability xD;;1;I can't even imagine how much time they spent doing this. Amazing.;;-1;http://CashTheTasks.com/?refer=9243;;1;GENIUS!!!...as usual!;;0;"Behind the scenes:https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=259&v=DF5qL4RMdqA";;1;Wow;;1;This song suck all the ass. BUT this video is genius!!;;0;___ __ _______?;;1;Amazing work! It's a wonder they haven't received a Video Vanguard Award by now. SMH;;1;This is the best band in 40 years. Their videos are the best videos since MTV died.  And here's to the Korg Monologue making a dual appearance. :)..... I love Ok Go.;;1;Thanks Youtube recommended;;-1;The music is some kind of shitty;;0;Charles Bouche you should already Bree subscribed to okgo instead odd the tending;;1;wow. just wow!!!;;1;se pasaron! amazing!!! <3 cla clap clap.;;1;How can you dislike this?

How are you suppose to avoid this, when the music videos are so perfect, and you want to watch it over and over again.;;1;you guys be cant be so brillant everytime....brilliant video guys...after sol long....fully worth the wait....brilliant...;;1;I'm not a huge fan of pop or pop/alternative or whatever, but I've grown to love several of this band's songs because of their brilliant videos.;;0;https://timebucks.com/?refID=214996001 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VacvQbug5s4;;0;Its looks cg ,not the actual printing for some part.;;1;Amazing as always.;;1;"Hey Mr Ok Go, for your next video I want computer synced drones with LED programmable pixel grids on their sides forming dancing shapes to the music within a snow covered landscape in the dark with them as the only light source. And a pink unicorn. I’m sure you’ll get right on it. Cheers. ;)";;0;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YmFmNbsyEo8;;0;..........;;1;Based on the comments I see here and on some of their other videos I feel like I'm the only who likes their music _ Not as much as the videos obviously, but I think the music they make complements and completes the awesome videos. It's like watching a movie. I might not listen to a song off the soundtrack otherwise, but you get more feeling out of a scene when the song playing just feels right for it. That being said I still would listen to their songs by themselves.;;0;https://timebucks.com/?refID=214996001 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VacvQbug5s4;;1;Okay. First off... yes, they did, in fact, recycle. Secondly, laser printers, not ink. Thirdly, actually printed. No chromakey or green screen. Don't believe me? https://youtu.be/BFh8iLfCIRQ . Especially the scenes when they're doing print tests. I only wish I knew what kind of printers they use, because I WANT one.;;-1;"I love OK Go and their videos, but this one is kind of disappointing. All the stop motion in between makes the video look artificial, so probably you wouldn't see any difference if they would have done the paper stuff with CGI. I really loved all the other videos before, especially ""Upside down & Inside Out"" and also the music itself, but this time it doesn't blow me away like the others, it's not even impressing me at all. :( I mean a good try but sadly not the level like the last years.";;0;Keniatan yang hqq;;1;OK Go is the definition of art.;;0;Why do you consider this normal? Is it clear that it is a mental desease (just kidding);;0;What printers were they using?;;0;that paper is graphic art or i am drunk;;0;Where the printers themselves recycled? That’s a lot of plastic waste!;;-1;So they make creative videos just to overcompensate for their lack of good music.;;0;R.I.P. Youtube compression;;1;We don't deserve your creativity _;;0;ammmmmmmmmmmmmmm, this is White stripse!!!!;;-1;Ok... and what about the cost in energy to print all that, and recycle it, and the fact that most recycled paper goes to secondary uses like toilet paper and tissues. Ok, so you made something that is extremely wasteful something slightly less wasteful... what a joke.;;-1;Oh NO! Watch out Lorax is coming;;-1;Thanks for the epilepsy warning asshole;;0;Anyone can identify the printer model? It looks like a printer that won't fail on me.;;1;Always love your music videos! So visually expressive and interactive, and you never know what is going to happen, so you feel so hooked just watching every little bit!;;-1;I am more curious about what brand of printer those are than what brand the paper is. Like those must be the best printers ever!;;0;Director: Dwight Schrute;;-1;Ok go have always been a band that does amazing video but mediocre music. It's a shame really.;;0;dundler mifflin might want to collab with Ok Go;;-1;They sound like the wiggles of 2017;;0;What a waste. Children in Africa could have eaten those ink cartridges.;;0;#______________;;1;Amazing!!;;0;its end love.. but with printers!;;1;You guys are really the most innovative and hats off for your effort and for this wonderful video..... amazing bros.,, Keep entertaining us ...again I saying the most innovative ever I seen for a songs all of urs are really really amazing;;0;Can you guys collaborate with daft punk?;;1;MrAbell12 yes yes *yes* y e s *Y E S*;;1;My computing teacher showed me this ever since I've been addicted to this;;0;Quien.

I remember when we all thought the treadmills were cool but where could they go from there? Boy we're we wrong;;1;This band always wins the internet. SO COOL!;;1;The legends are back!

Keep making videos like this! So far I loved all of them!;;1;"“Why do you guys always make avant-garde, expensive, bold videos?”“It’s obsession.”";;0;lol;;1;Without a doubt the second most interesting commercial I've ever seen.;;1;You guys give me chills EVERY TIME! oh my god;;0;Nice vid. Not too keen on the song though;;1;You made a good impression!;;1;You made a good impression!;;1;Thank you so much :);;0;you guys could make a container of sour cream entertaining, I swear;;0;lo volvieron a  hacer volvieron a deleitar mi vista y mis oidos con una obra maestra estoy anodado  me encantgo este video como muchisimos otros mas;;0;This reminds me of Gorillaz for some reason. Not saying that's a bad thing.;;0;"A lot of paper for this stupid song?SUCKS!";;0;Anyone else notice Damian slip on some paper at 1:19?;;0;Not a single paper jam in video. Obviously fake.;;0;Dunder Mifflin will not be able to compete against that...;;1;where do you even get these ideas???;;0;1:19 CAREFUL THERE MATE! __;;-1;Proof that bands no longer care about the song! Just the video.;;0;PC Load Letter;;0;can't help but get this feel from Gumby...;;1;HOLY COW! These guys did it again!;;1;Every year their videos get more and more creative. This is mind blowing.

Great song and spectacular video. Thanks so much for blowing my mind again... I don't think there is much left, so give me some time to recover... :-);;1;I love this song and video;;-1;It's cool and all. But I wonder if they're starting to run out of video ideas?;;1;Awesome;;1;Dope!!!!;;-1;WTF;;-1;Why do they bother with the music? Just skip to the gimmicky video;;1;THEY'VE DONE IT AGAINNNNN!;;0;WHAT IS THE MEANING OF LIFE;;1;Another amazing video by okgo YASSS GJ!!!!!!!!!!!!________;;0;Love'em but this has to be the most stupid video they have done. A screen set, and some projection mapping would have achieved the same effects especially because they ran a static capture feel. Refresh issues would have been none existent.;;1;An 'OK Go' music video never fails to disappoint. I know their sound isn't for everyone, but I personally enjoy it.;;0;Okay, so I know what kind of paper to buy, but what kind of printer is that?;;1;There are a lot of comments so I don't think the band will see this one, but if anyone on the creative team does I just want to suggest the concept of using 360 view with a music video, it is a new technology that has not really been used to its full, and I think it would be one of the most groundbreaking things this already legendary band could do, like if you agree.;;0;must be the herron;;0;What printers were used??;;0;Didn't like the music but liked the video;;1;its the best of the OK GO, both video and song, it's obsession! thx guys, you are incredible!;;0;"A look so quick, a movement so slightYou could almost imagine it didn't just happenBut everything will change, in just one look, one little glanceIt's not passing fascination now, it's obsessionUh huh, it's obsessionIt's obsessionUh huh, it's obsessionIt's obsessionAnd it's physicalIt's like standing at the edge:Your blood starts to pump, 'cause you're worried you might jumpAnd your head throbbing like a heartAnd your heart throbbing like a drumAnd the drums throbbing like the point is just go ahead and jumpIt's obsessionUh huh, it's obsessionIt's obsessionUh huh, it's obsessionIt's obsessionThere's only one way out [x4]A look so quick, a movement so slightOh it's not passing fascination now, it's obsessionIt's obsessionUh huh, it's obsessionIt's obsessionUh huh, it's obsessionIt's obsession";;1;los amo_;;0;What a waste, the kids in Africa could've eaten that paper;;0;This is a good video and i know this was done only one time because there is one printer that miss the sync and wasn't edited.;;1;Oh my flipping Gosh;;0;How many paper cuts?;;1;Please share a behind the scene!;;1;I don't like their music I just love their videos they're creative as hell;;-1;Recycled that paper but you ain’t never getting all them fucking ink cartridges back.;;0;<CE3;;1;Every music video is a piece of art;;-1;If Hot Chip are a brilliant small independent cafe, then these are like Starbucks.

I've been thinking about this need for artists to express themselves in ever grander and more inventive ways.... Don't suppose they thought this pollution aspect through here so I am not pointing fingers... Young kids at school need to be taught about our artistic expression in a free nation - and the potential for detrimental, deleterious impact of each artist - all to assuage our egotistical desire for our 15 minutes of attention - on the health of the Earth and its environment. This clip is probably ""beautiful"" to you (arguably) but only briefly - as a disposable gimmick - a novelty - a small curiosity - like bubblegum maybe - a couple of minutes of your attention - .... but then consider the damage, the sheer waste..... The electricity, the ink, the toxins and the paper - the trees... The money.... The starving people close by... All because of an individual's artistic personal greed and vanity? Vandalism of the Earth. Selfishness without our being aware of this...I am sure this was unwitting, but if not, then it is a sin. I sound like a killjoy - sorry. But If the artist could think more, maybe he could find a small piece of old paper and a take a pencil and make a drawing or poem that will be treasured far more without hurting the world - and uplifting spirits just as much, if not more. That's futurism - if there's going to be a future.I say this as someone guilty of this type of vandalism who learned the hard way what guilt feels like.";;0;dunder mifflin is quaking;;1;Dunder Mifflin has really stepped up their game!;;1;Love Ok Go;;-1;I'm studying for exams and realized too late that this is the wrong video to watch at 2am.;;0;"Lol.

Do they want all content to be completely self funded all the time? It’s so confusing to me that people can dislike this when it’s obvious that hours and hours of planning, programming, and shooting was done to make 3 minutes of entertaining video given to us for FREE and all we have to bear is at most a 15 sec ad and an end card with the company that helped make it which is less intrusive than most youtubers when it comes to advertising in videos.

They need funding, so they go to advertisers, if a video is sponsored it doesn't automatically mean that the video is an ad.;;;This is *amazing* as expected. But I feel that it didn't end up as incredibly perfect as The One Moment, or Upside Down & Inside Out. Also, the choreography is, imho, one of the least inventive of OK Go so far.
